# Database Design

Database design principles is a course that teaches the basics of how to create, manage, and use database systems. Databases are systems that store and organize data in a structured way, allowing users to query, manipulate, and analyze the data efficiently. Database design is the process of defining the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data in a database.

The learning objectives of an introductory course for database design and concept are:

* To understand the concepts and principles that underlie how databases work, such as data models, schemas, keys, normalization, and transactions.

* To learn the different types of databases and database management systems, such as relational, hierarchical, network, object-oriented, and NoSQL databases.

* To acquire the skills to use a database language, such as SQL (Structured Query Language), to create, read, update, and delete data in a database.

* To apply the knowledge and skills to design and implement a simple database system for a given problem or scenario.

* To explore the current trends and challenges in database technology, such as big data, data warehousing, data mining, and cloud computing.
