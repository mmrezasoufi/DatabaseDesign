# Human Resource Management System

# Run
## Venv And Dependencies
Create a virtual env, then install dependencies with pip.

Linux

source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Windows
```cmd
python -m virtualenv .venv
.\\venv\bin\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Migration
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
## Create Admin

```
you can optionally specify a IP and port

# Normalization
Every table besides `buildings_has_departmend`, `personels_has_meetings` and `courses_has_personels` has an integer id as their primarly key and they don't have any other condidate keys. for those other three table mentioned they are all either created by only keys or there is the score value with has only functional dependancy `course_id personel_id -> score` and is only dependent to it's primarly key.

With arguments mentioned above we only need to prove this schema is in 3rd Normal Form.

There is no functional dependencies between non-prime atributes, so schema is in 3rd Normal Form and thus is in BCNF
